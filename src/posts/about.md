## Skills

I describe a little bit some technologies, my relationship with it and what I can do, alternatives are my second options to each one.

**Ruby/Rails**: After some years developing using PHP/Zend, when met Ruby/Rails in 2010 was love at first sight, and never looked back. I love the language philosophy, its productivity, semantics how it's focused on developer happiness.
_Alternatives: Node/Express, Crystal/Kemal/Lucky_
> I can develop full web systems, REST/GraphQL APIs, use design patterns, functional programming, have contributed to a lot of open source projects and use on a daily basis. I know the internals of the Rails framework, can optimize Ruby considering memory allocation, performance and uses in some other cases like CLI (Command Line).

**ES6/React**: To become a complete web developer, I focused 2016 and 2017 studying and improving JavaScript, the solution I felt more comfortable was using ES6/React/PropTypes. I also have delivered projects using React Native.
_Alternatives: Preact, Vue, TypeScript_
> I can create a SPA (with redux, offline support), consuming a REST or GraphQL API, architect the application, test the behavior, do E2E testing and make performance tuning. I'm also comfortable using JSS/Styled Components.

**PostgreSQL**: I worked several years (2005-2010) with MySQL, Ruby community uses a lot of PostgreSQL and after using it, started to feel home, nowadays I feel comfortable using it for time series, geospatial, jsonb (specially for NoSQL usage), trees, full text. Also, the management is simple and robust.
_Alternatives: MySQL_
> Can configure and manage for HA, backup and point-in-time recovery, analyze the performance of queries, and even the server performance, cache size, disk, and memory usage.

**Puppet**: Many years managing servers, use config management was a natural way, Puppet is simple, has a powerful DSL and has been the first mover for years, I use it from configuring my notebook, pet projects to production servers.
_Alternatives: Chef_
> Use 3rd party and develop own modules, keep the auditable using it standalone or together with puppet server. Use Hiera (also encrypted) as ENC and develop some solutions on top of it.

**C**: I'm Bachelor in Computer Science, I never worked professionally with C, but as my first programming language, I have a deep love with it, love its simplicity, foundation and how it has been in use over decades.
_Alternatives: Crystal, Node_
> I have fun with C

## Languages

- Portuguese: It's my native language, have its phonetic/nasal sounds, much punctuation, but I love it :)
- English: As a developer I've been reading tech and non-tech articles since 2000, conversation I started to develop in 2005 calling service providers, and writing is my weak point, but always practicing and improving while I write on my site. Nowadays I can keep a conversation for hours ;)
- Spanish: As Brazilian, we are close to many Spanish-spoken countries, I like the language, I can understand (from Spain is harder for me), and maybe I can have some small talks
- German: I also love this language, started studying on DW _Deutsch, Warum Nicht?_ by myself, I can read some phrases, speaking is way hard to me, but trying to improve.
