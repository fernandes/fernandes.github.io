# Respect

As this website is versioned under git version-control system, you can check the full history of this file on [Github](https://github.com/fernandes/fernandes.github.io/commits/master/src/routes/respect.md)

This website is run solely by one person, [me](/about).

This website is based on mutual respect, what it means? I **don't** use **any** 3rd party services that tracks you, nothing like Google Analytics, Social Media (Facebook, Twitter) widgets that is used to track you.

If you navigate on this site, we collect some technical data to ensure no problem is happening and to measure the performance.

If you log in to comment on this website, the comments will be stored based solely on the information you provide.

As I don't use any widgets, if you'd like to share some post/article with a friend, you can use our widget that sends via e-mail, and I ensure you, that won't add either you and your friend e-mail to any mailing list.

My mailing list is used solely by communicating purposes with who, actively, told us that want to have a conversation with me, I want to talk with awesome people that wanna talk back to me. Period.

How this site makes money? Simple, it doesn't! My job is being a web developer, here is a place where I share information with friends, giving back to the community that always helped me. This site is my _experiment_ over a simple, free web. Where the owner and the users have full control of the medium.

You can share and modify any work on this website, this is your right, your only duty is to distribute the work with the same licensing described on the [Creative Commons](#creative-commons) section, any futher information, just get in [contact](/contact)

## Mailing List

I believe in a free internet, where everyone controls its data, has the right to privacy and if you want to share any data, that does it consciously.

Based on this principle, I've chosen to use the mailing list as a primary way of communicating with people I care and want to talk to me. I write by myself all mail sent to the mailing list and read/reply to every mail replied.

I do not use social media to communicate two-way to anyone regarding the contents of this website, I use my social media to make some divulgation about some published article and the site itself.

Welcome!
